# Simplified iOS Utilities
This is a collection of utilities I used in many projects, the Simplified suite of products and code bases for iOS.

# Objectives
Generality: the classes and functions should be general-purpose enough to be used independently of the product they are used in.
Absolutely no third party dependencies: we want to be able to use this module anywhere without any additional requirements.
Testability: every utility should be easily unit-testable.

it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager from xcode :

File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency...

enter package URL : https://github.com/amrangry/ClockWise.git , choose the latest release

### Manually
To install manually the ClockWise classes in your app, just drag the Source class files (demo files and assets are not needed) into your project.

Add content of folder Source/* to your project

## How it works "Usage"
1. Import `ClockWise` module to your `Swift` class
```swift
    import ClockWise
```
2. Enjoy

# Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

this project adheres to [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
